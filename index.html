    <a class="button show-more">Mission Statement</a>
    <div class="hidden-info">
      I've always enjoyed creativity, in a structured kind of way. Problem
      solving, making things fit, or work well, is somehow rewarding. I like
      that sense of completion, when things come together, to flow
      beautifully. <br />
      <br />I think in this modern, technological world, there's a chance to
      make an impact. The internet is a mega powerful tool, which can be
      harnessed for great things. It is my hope that I can be a part of that.

    <a class="button show-more">My Background</a>
    <div class="hidden-info">
      Born in Brighton, England, I've tried my hand at a few things. With an
      interest in the mind, I made a diploma in hypnotherapy in 2003, which
      led me to explore meditation and yoga. Some years later I pursued a
      yearning to make things out of wood, to build in a very physical way,
      and studied carpentry. Throughout this time I worked in social care,
      mainly with people with autism and learning disabilities. <br /><br />A
      few years ago I moved to Berlin with my family and decided to pursue web
      development, out of a desire to be involved in helping to steer
      technology in a beneficial direction.<br /><br />
      Aside from programming, I also enjoy juggling, painting and being in
      nature.

        In this app users can search for web development events by city and
        adjust the number of events displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with
        REACT. It uses the Google Calandar API to fetch events. During the
        build, unit and integration tests were implimented, as well as
        end-to-end tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The start of this project was my biggest challenge, setting up AWS
        Lambda and writing the authentication code. I got stuck with a bug for
        a while which I discovered to be a simple indentation that I'd missed.
        But as soon as the application was up I enjoyed creating the different
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still prefer to make features first and then think about the test
        senarios after, but I'm slowly getting my head around how to think
        through the tests first.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were times when I would hit a problem, trying to get something
        to display a certain way, but there's nothing more satisfying than
        resolving it. And sometimes discovering a neat trick or a way to do
        things that was better than my original idea. There's always lots of
        cool stuff to learn!
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project I find the charts and graphs a bit pointless from a
        UX point of view, but feel they are more of a showcase to practice and
        display different things I can develop.

      <h1>Pok√©dex Web App</h1>
      <p>
        This application displays a list of Pokemon which the user can click
        on to uncover Pokemon statistics. <br /><br />
        It uses the Bootstrap framework and was written in HTML5, CSS3,
        JavaScript and JQuery. It loads data from an external Pokemon API.
