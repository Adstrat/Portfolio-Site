        <h1 >Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>
          I've always enjoyed creativity, in a structured kind of way. Problem
          solving, making things fit, or work well, is somehow rewarding.
          I like that sense of completion, when things come together, to flow beautifully. <br>
          <br>I think in this modern, technological world, there's a chance to make an impact.
          The internet is a mega powerful tool, which can be harnessed for great things.
          It is my hope that I can be a part of that.
        </p>
        <h1>My Background</h1>
        <p>Born in Brighton, England, I've tried my hand at a few things. With an interest in the
          mind, I made a diploma in hypnotherapy in 2003, which led me to explore meditation and yoga.
          Some years later I pursued a yearning to make things out of wood, to build in a very physical
          way, and studied carpentry. Throughout this time I worked in social care, mainly with people
          with autism and learning disabilities. <br><br>A few years ago I moved to Berlin with my family and
          decided to pursue web development, out of a desire to be involved in helping to
          steer technology in a beneficial direction.<br><br>
          Aside from programming, I also enjoy juggling, painting and being in nature.

          <h2>Pok√©dex Web App</h2>
          <p>
            This application displays a list of Pokemon which the user can click on to uncover
            Pokemon statistics. <br><br>
            It uses the Bootstrap framework and was written in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. It
            loads data from an external Pokemon API.
