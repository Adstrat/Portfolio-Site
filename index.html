    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
      Born in Brighton, England, I've tried my hand at a few things. With an
      interest in the mind, I made a diploma in hypnotherapy in 2003, which
      led me to explore meditation and yoga. Some years later I pursued a
      yearning to make things out of wood, to build in a very physical way,
      and studied carpentry. Throughout this time I worked in social care,
      mainly with people with autism and learning disabilities.
      <br /><br />
      A few years ago I moved to Berlin with my family and decided to pursue a
      career in web development, out of a desire to be involved in helping to steer
      technology in a beneficial direction.
      <br /><br />
      I've always enjoyed creating, in a structured kind of way. Problem
      solving, making things fit, or work well, is somehow rewarding. I like
      that sense of completion, when things come together, to flow
      beautifully. <br />
      <br />I think in this modern, technological world, there's a chance to
      make an impact. The internet is a mega powerful tool, which can be
      harnessed for great things. It is my hope that I can be a part of that.
      <br><br>
      Aside from programming, I also enjoy juggling, painting and being in
      nature.
    </p>

      <h1>Meet App</h1>
      <p>
        This app is a serverless, Progressive Web Application (PWA) built with
        REACT, using the Google Calendar API to fetch events. During the
        build, unit, integration and end-to-end tests were implemented.
      </p>
      <p class="show-more">Read more</p>
      <div class="hidden-info">
        <p>
          In this app, users can search for events by inputing different cities and
          choosing the number of events to be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The start of this project was my biggest challenge, setting up AWS
          Lambda and writing the authentication code. I got stuck with a bug for
          a while which I discovered to be a simple indentation that I'd missed.
          But as soon as the application was up, I enjoyed creating the
          different features.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still prefer to make features first and then think about the test
          scenarios after, but I'm slowly getting my head around how to think
          through the tests first.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were times when I would hit a problem, trying to get something
          to display a certain way, but there's nothing more satisfying than
          resolving it. And sometimes discovering a neat trick or a way to do
          things that was better than my original idea. There's always lots of
          cool stuff to learn!
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project I feel the charts and graphs are not overly useful
          from a UX point of view, but they are more of a showcase to practice
          and display different things that I can develop.

      <h1>Pok√©dex Web App</h1>
      <p>
        I built this app using the Bootstrap framework, and wrote it in HTML5,
        CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. It loads data from an external Pokemon
        API.
      </p>
      <p class="show-more">Read more</p>
      <div class="hidden-info">
        <p>
          This application displays Pokemon buttons, which the user can click on
          to uncover Pokemon statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning how to extract data from an API is a great skill to have, not
          just from the documentation, but also from the console. This project
          really helped me to get a grasp of inspecting in the developer tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I often find with coding, it's the small details which make a
          difference. I had a few issues centralising the title on the navbar,
          but tweaking image sizes and padding aligned everything. I feel, too,
          that small details, like adding a space after each comma for the types
          of Pokemon (which doesn't happen automatically), are necessary for a
          satisfying user experience.

      <h1>MyFlix80s</h1>
      <p>
        I built this app using the MERN stack (mongodb, express, react and node).
        It is the client side of a previous backend project where I developed the
        database.

          This project displays films from the 1980s. Users can find information
          about directors, genres, year of release and so on, by clicking
          through the different page views.
        </p>
        <p>
          React is not the easiest of libraries to master, but getting the hang
          of props and states and finally being able to create a Single Page
          Application (SPA) is a huge achievement. It's such a powerful tool to
          have!
        </p>
        <p>
          I often find the trickiest past of any project is the user
          authentication process. It takes a great deal of mental stamina and
          patience to succeed in having a working login, registration and update
          section. And that's what a big part of this project was about!
