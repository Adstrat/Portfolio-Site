      <section class="bio">
        <p>
          Originally from England, I have bachelors degree in
          Politics, Philosopy and Economics, a diploma in
          hypnotherapy, and have spent a lot of time exploring meditation and yoga.
          I spent many years doing social work, supporting people with autism and learning
          disabilities.
          <br /><br />
          A few years ago I moved to Berlin with my family and decided to pursue
          a career in web development, out of a desire to be involved in helping
          to steer technology in a beneficial direction. And in July 2021 I completed
          a Full Stack Web-Development Bootcamp at Career Foundry.
          <br /><br />
          I've always enjoyed creating, in a structured kind of way. Problem
          solving, making things fit, or work well, is somehow rewarding. I like
          that sense of completion, when things come together, to flow
          beautifully.
          <br /><br />
          Some years ago I studied carpentry, just for fun, and I love making functional, built-in
          furniture. I get that same feeling of being in the groove from programming, especially
          front-end, when playing around with the look of a website, until it feels just right.
          <br><br>
          I think in this modern, technological world, there's a chance to make
          an impact. The internet is a mega powerful tool, which can be
          harnessed for great things. And it's my hope that I can contribute my skills
          towards improving the world in some way.
          <br /><br />
          Aside from programming, I also enjoy juggling, painting, writing and
          being in nature.

        <p>
          Through my studies at CareerFoundry I've gained a solid understanding of
          web development concepts, and have dedicated a lot of my free time to apply
          these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications.

        I love to keep learning and trying out new technologies. Take a look at some of the projects

          <h1>Meet App</h1>
          <p>
            A serverless, Progressive Web Application allowing users
            to search for events on Google Calender.
          </p>
          <div class="hidden-info">
            <p>
              Meet App was built with <span class="small-caps">REACT</span>. Users can search for events in different
              cities and choose the number of events to be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the start of this project I set up <span class="small-caps">AWS</span> Lambda and added the
              authentication code. This was a steep learning curve, and I got stuck
              for a while with a bug, but after some perserverence I managed to
              resolve it.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the build, unit, integration and end-to-end tests were implemented.
              Initially it seemed like a strange concept for me to write the tests before
              the actual code, but I appreciate how this can save time in the long-run.
            </p>
            <p>
              There were times when I would hit a problem, trying to get something
              to display a certain way, but there's nothing more satisfying than
              resolving it. And sometimes discovering a neat trick or a way to do
              things that was better than my original idea. There's always lots of
              cool stuff to learn!

            An application displaying Pokemon statistics.

            <p>
              This app loads data from an external Pokemon <span class="small-caps">API</span>. I built the <span
                class="small-caps">UI</span> with
              Bootstrap and wrote the logic with JQuery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning how to extract data from an <span class="small-caps">API</span> is a great skill to have,
              not just from the documentation, but also by querying the console. This
              project really helped me to get a grasp of inspecting in the
              developer tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              I often find with coding, it's the small details which make a
              difference. I had a few issues centralising the title on the navbar,
              but tweaking image sizes and padding aligned everything. I feel,
              too, that small details, like adding a space after each comma for
              the types of Pokemon (which doesn't happen automatically), are
              necessary for a satisfying user experience.

            <p>
              This was an exciting project, to develop an online social media chat room! It was a great
              feeling when up and running and I could create chat messages between the emulator
              and my mobile.
