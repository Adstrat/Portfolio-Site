              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                MyFlix80s is a React App I built displaying films from the 1980s. Users can learn
                about different films by clicking through the page views.
              </p>
              <p>
                The initial page users see is a login. From here they can either login their details or go to a
                registration page to set up a new account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a user has logged in they're taken to a main page which displays cards with all the films.

                Users can navigate to pages to see more details about each film, different genres and directors.
                They can also add films to their list of favourites.

                From the naviagtion bar, users can view their profile details, where there's the option to update and

              <h2>Tools Used</h2>
              <p>
                The app was built using the <span class="small-caps">MERN</span> stack:
              </p>
              <ul class="skills">
                <li>mongodb</li>
                <li>express</li>
                <li>react</li>
                <li>node.js</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                It was split into two main projects - the back and front-end, which work together to bring the data
                through to visually experience the app.
              </p>

                <h2>Back-End Development</h2>
                <p>
                  The first part of the project involved developing a <span class="small-caps">REST</span>ful
                  <span class="small-caps">API</span>
                  and creating a <span class="small-caps">NoSQL</span> database. The <span class="small-caps">API</span>
                  contains the logic for accessing
                  both the data about each film and allowing users to create a secure, personal account.
                <p>
                  Feel free to view the code for the

              <h2>User Authentication</h2>
              <p>
                The user authentication process was the trickiest part of this project.
                Working on the back-end taught me a lot about the logic needed to maintain high standards
                of security. And the front-end required a lot of thought to implement effective error handling.

                <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
                <p>
                  For the user interface I used <span class="small-caps">REACT</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  User Flow Diagrams helped me to map out how to arrange the props and states
                  for each view.

                <p>
                  Reusable components were taken from React Bootstrap.

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>
              While I feel more confident with front-end development, I enjoyed developing the <span
                class="small-caps">API</span> and creating a
              database and would like to expand these skills in future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project helped to solidify my React knowledge, such as using hooks and updating the states.
              At the end I successfully changed some of the states to be managed with Redux, just for practice. I feel
              this is something I'd like to explore more as it's important when working on bigger projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoyed working the most on the User Interface. Playing around with the <span
                class="small-caps">CSS</span>
              to see how different elements respond. This is a particular area that I intend to extend and explore as I
              continue on my web development journey.
            </p>
